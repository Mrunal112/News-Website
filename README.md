# News-Website
Discover the latest news from around the world on our fully functional news website. With a sleek design powered by HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, stay informed with up-to-date articles. Make sure you never miss a headline you're interested in by searching for news on any topic.


## News Website using News API 

This website would be a great resource for people who want to stay up-to-date on current events. It would also be a valuable tool for researchers and students who need to find information on a specific topic.

Here are some additional details about the website:

â€¢ It would use a news API to fetch the latest news articles from a variety of sources.

â€¢ It would use a search bar to allow users to search for news articles on any topic.

â€¢ It would display the search results in a list format, with each article including the title, author, publication date, and a summary of the article.

â€¢ Users would be able to click on an article to read it in full and will be directed to another page.

I hope this helps!
